BEFORE RUNNING THE JAR FILE!!!
-----------------------------------------
Change the name (blahblah.jar) to blahblah.zip *IF YOU DONT SEE THE .jar GO TO BOTTOM*

then open it up


Grab the versions  folder and move it out

make sure the version folder is in THE SAME FOLDER as the MinecraftUpdater


**Change the blahblah.zip back to blahblah.jar!**

Now run the jar file !Scrubs!



*******************************
Trouble Shooting
